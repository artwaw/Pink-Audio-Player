# Pink Audio Player

Versatile, macOS audio player. 

I wrote that as I missed something as simple in use as the Foobar is on Windows. <br>
While I know there is Foobar on macOS it is not to be confused with the Windows one. So I wrote my own. <br>
Compiled releases are available from the releases page.

## Features (existing and planned)

Plays audio files and streams. Simple in use. Library function for quick access.
Please consider Github Pages and Wiki for more details.

## What is working now?

- Playlists.
- Adding local files and folders to the playlists (nested folders don't work yet).
- Playback and volume controls.
- Multimedia tags are being read and displayed in the playlists.

## What is missing?

Everything else, really. I will keep adding things as I get around it.
I code in my spare time.

## 3rd party ack

I use TagLib to read (and possibly write) tags.
